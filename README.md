Github Pages Website Repo - set up to allow workshop attendees to fork & create their own blog/portfolio/website. 

# Setup

All you need is Git & a text editor. I use Visual Studio Code - but sublime, atom, etc are all great as they provide syntax assisting tools. 

### OS X - Homebrew Install

If you use [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/), you can install Git using the following command:

    brew install git

### Official Download

You can also [download an installer for Git rom the official web site](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

Once you have Git installed, follow the instructions in **Getting Ready**, below.

### Getting Ready with Git

Now that you've got Git installed, let's make sure you can access it, and that it's fully set up for you to use.

From your shell (Git Shell, Git Bash, or other terminal application of your choosing), type the following, replacing `YOUR NAME` with — you guessed it — your name.

    git config --global user.name "YOUR NAME"

You'll also want to set up your email address.

    git config --global user.email "YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS"

Assuming these commands run without errors, you're good to go! Otherwise, you may need to double-check your Git installation & Google is your best friend in this case.

### Download VS Code
Follow instructions here: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/learn/get-started/basics)

## Usage

```python
import foobar

# returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('word')

# returns 'geese'
foobar.pluralize('goose')

# returns 'phenomenon'
foobar.singularize('phenomena')
```
