Github Pages Website Repo - set up to allow Workshop attendees to fork & create their own blog/portfolio/website. 

# Setup

All you need to get started is git & a text editor. I use Visual Studio Code - but sublime, atom, etc are all great as they provide syntax assisting tools. 

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install foobar.

```bash
pip install foobar
```

## Usage

```python
import foobar

# returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('word')

# returns 'geese'
foobar.pluralize('goose')

# returns 'phenomenon'
foobar.singularize('phenomena')
```
